					<div class="col-md-8 questions">
						<h5>Are there different types of Guardianships?</h5>

						<p>Yes! Full Guardianships "of the Person and Estate" give the Guardian full responsibility to manage the incapacited persons living situation, healthcare and medical decisions, as well as to manage their finances. Sometimes the court may limit the authority of the Guardian in certain areas, depending upon the incapacitated persons need or situation. This is called a limited Guardianship.
It may be that a Guardian is appointed for an "of the person" only Guardianship or for an"of the estate" only authority. This depends upon the person's situation and need.</p><br>
						<h5>What is the role of a Professional Guardian?</h5>

						<p>To minimize risk and to protect the individual from harm (either financial and/or health & safety). A Professional Guardian is trusted by the court to do what is "in the best interest of the incapacitated person" at all times.
</p><br>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h5>What happens if you don't know (for sure) that someone needs a  Guardian? Are there other Alternatives?</h5>

<p>Usually, a Guardian Ad Litem is appointed before a Guardian. A Guardian Ad Litem gathers all the facts about the individual case and gives a report to the court. This report addresses the incapacity level & the needs of the individual (including statements and assessments by physicians, family members and care providers). It may be that a combination of services may be needed. For example, a Guardian "of the person" to be responsible for health & safety needs and a Limited Power of Attorney or Representative Payee for financial concerns or a Guardian "of the Estate" for full financial protection and a Power of Attorney for Healthcare. There could be a variety of combinations to address a persons need. The "least restrictive alternative" will be chosen.It may be that a local professional person can work with a family member (as a team) to meet the Individual's need and a Guardianship can be avoided altogether.


</p><br>
<h5>Who supervises the Guardian?</h5>

<p>A Professional Guardian is supervised by the court. All "Interested Parties" are given copies of the Guardian's reports to the court.</p><br>

<h5>What about the cost? Is a Professional Guardian Expensive?</h5>

<p>Guardians are paid directly from the funds of the incapacitated persons estate. Professional Guardians are paid professional fees ranging from about $60.00 to $80.00 per hour. The court requires that all fees for services are documented and that they be proved " just and reasonable". When someone needs a Professional Guardian that is also receiving DSHS (Department of Social and Health Services) assistance in a residential facility or nursing care facility, a portion of their income can be used to pay for Guardianship services. These funds are limited and paid out in a fixed amount monthly.</p><br>

<h5>What is the difference between  Representative Payee Services and Bill Paying asssistance?</h5>
<p>A Representative payee is named as payee (in addition to the individual) on government checks, such as Social Security checks. A representative payee is responsible for making sure that the individual's basic living needs are met (food, shelter, clothing & other obligations) within their income limitations and reports back to the government agency that issues the check as to the disposition of the funds.
Bill paying assistance is available to anyone, regardless of their income, by signing a Limited Financial Power of Attorney (for bill paying services). Bill paying assistance assures that the bills and other obligations get paid on time, provides help with budgeting and decision making and is helpful for individuals that want to stay in control of their money but want help to do so.</p>

						<h2>Professional Profiles</h2>
						<p>Biographical Information: When choosing a Professional Guardian, education, qualifications and experience count! However, a Client/Guardian relationship is also a uniquely personal one too. Personality and individuality should also be taken into consideration. The client and their family or care givers need feel comfortable with the Guardian to problem solve through difficult situations or decisions.
